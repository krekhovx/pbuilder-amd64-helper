Description: Tool that automates routine work with Debian packages
 This is a wrapper script around pbuilder, pdebuild, and debootstrap.
 It creates a chroot environment for the amd64 architecture and builds
 a deb package within it. The utility checks that the deb package complies
 with Debian Policy standards.
